# Restaurant App

- Restaurant App lists the best rating restaurants with the information of user's location info and which type of restaurant the user wants to. Users will have 2 different lists on their profile page. The first list will be about restaurants that users want to go to some time and the other list will be about their favorite restaurants. If they change their mind about the items in their list they can easily delete the item they want to.

## Techs

- React Library
- Zomato API
- Bootstrap
- Express.js
- Mongo DB

## Steps

- Homepage and the page user goes after making a search page must contain a search bar. That search bar will take city and meal category information from the user. After that, the page will list the best-rated restaurants.   

- If the user wants to see detailed info about the restaurant user wants to go he/she will be able to see the detailed info about that restaurant.

- A user will be able to sign up to the website and then be able to log in to his/her profile page.

- After that he/she can make his/her lists on their profile pages.

## The Goals We Want To Have If We Can Finish The First Steps

- Restaurants will have unusual tags like " good to have a meeting " or " great place to hang out with friends " and that will help the user to find the exact location user wants to find easily.

- The restaurant's location will be displayed with the help of Google Map

## Work Sharing


- While Emine and I were working on how to make a connection with our website and the Zomato API Ali Said will make searches about Express.js and MongoDB for dealing with user sign up and login parts. Generally, everybody has a touch on every inch of this project.
